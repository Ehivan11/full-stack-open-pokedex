I picked Phyton for the language, And I found Pylint to use as a tool for linting.
For making tests the most used is Pytest, we can make unit and integration tests with this tool.
Also, there are other frameworks like Playwright from Microsoft and Selenium.
To make an automated build you should try PyBuilder.

There are too many tools to make continuous integration, some of them that are more used are GitLab CI,
Bamboo, CircleCI, and TeamCity. But the favorite ones at this point are Jenkins for self-hosted setups and
GitHub Actions for cloud-based solutions.

I think that the best option to consider at this point will be cloud-based. First I have to know the size and how advanced the application is. And then I consider that if the app is in active development and will be released soon. It's the first version, so for now we can use a cloud-based option like GitHub Actions, and then when the application grows up. We will talk about a self-hosted option like Jenkins to have more control over the app.

Sorry for the short text that I wrote, but I'm not a native English speaker.
